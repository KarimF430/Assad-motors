It comes standard with six airbags, electronic stability control, vehicle stability management, and a Level 2 advanced driver assistance system that covers 19 different safety features. \n\nIn terms of comfort, I've got to say the Creta's got some nice touches. You'll find a panoramic sunroof that you can control with your voice, ventilated front seats to keep you cool on hot days, and an 8-way power driver seat for adjusting to your liking.\n\nNow, let's talk about the tech. The Creta's got a pair of 10.25-inch screens - one for the infotainment system and another for the cluster display. And if you're an audiophile, you'll appreciate the Bose sound system with eight speakers. It's also got Bluelink connectivity, which allows you to connect your phone and access all sorts of features.\n\nWhen it comes to the engine, you've got three options: petrol, diesel, and turbo petrol. And to go along with that, there are four transmission choices to suit your driving style.","cons":"Price Premium: The Creta's higher variants, which come equipped with ADAS and Turbo Multi-Clutch, do command a premium price compared to the base models. You'll need to budget a bit more if you're looking for these advanced features.\n\nRear Seat Width: The Creta's rear seat is spacious enough for two, but it can be a squeeze to fit three adults comfortably, especially when compared to some of its wider competitors. If you often find yourself carrying a full load of passengers, you might want to consider other options.\n\nNo Safety Rating (Facelift): As the latest facelift of the Creta has not yet undergone Global NCAP crash testing, we don't have an official safety rating for this new iteration. It's worth mentioning that the pre-facelift model did manage to secure a 3-star rating.","summary":"So you're looking at the Hyundai Creta, right? It's a solid mid-size SUV with a pretty impressive feature list. I mean, the interior space is generous, and you'll find a ton of amenities, like blind-spot monitoring, 360-degree camera, and even a panoramic sunroof.\n\nThe driving experience is pretty good, to be honest. The 1.5-litre petrol and diesel engines are both respectable options, and the automatic and manual gearboxes are smooth. What's more, it's not like one engine is a clear winner over the other - both handle pretty well. It's a decent choice, and the quality feels consistent throughout.","maxPrice":2019855,"minPrice":1072589,"brandName":"Hyundai","searchScore":1,"matchType":"exact","isEV":false},{"_id":"691d7295995000436a238862","id":"model-brand-hyundai-creta-n-line","name":"Creta N Line","brandId":"brand-hyundai","bodyType":"SUV","fuelTypes":["petrol"],"pros":"Powerful Engine: The 1.5L Turbo GDi engine comes with thrilling acceleration and highway speeds.\nSporty Handling: Tuned suspension and weighted steering make it fun to drive around bends.\nAggressive Looks: N Line specific body kit, 18-inch wheels, and red accents look very feature-rich.\nhas Tech: Comes with dual 10.25-inch screens, Level 2 ADAS, and ventilated seats.","cons":"Firm Ride: The stiffer suspension means you might feel bumps more than the standard Creta.\nFuel Efficiency: The powerful turbo engine can be thirsty if driven aggressively.\nPrice: It commands a premium price over the standard petrol variants.","summary":"I've been checking out the Creta N Line, and it's a real performance-oriented take on the standard Creta. It's got a unique grille, which looks pretty sharp, along with 18-inch sporty wheels and red accents inside and out – it's a nice touch. Under the hood, you get a turbo engine that's decently potent, producing 158 BHP, and it comes with some sporty transmission options to match. Overall, it's a great blend of SUV practicality and hot hatch fun, making it a solid choice if you want a performance-oriented vehicle.","maxPrice":2009138,"minPrice":1782628,"brandName":"Hyundai","searchScore":0.95,"matchType":"exact","isEV":false},{"_id":"693d0824f6e9e61342ee8399","id":"model-brand-mercedes-benz-maybach-s-class","name":"Maybach S-Class","brandId":"brand-mercedes-benz","bodyType":"Sedan","fuelTypes":["petrol"],"pros":"• top-level luxury sedan expression.\n• Rear executive seats with massage.\n• V12 option available.\n• Bespoke customization options.","cons":"• Ultra-premium Rs 2.5+ crore pricing.\n• Chauffeur-focused, not driver-focused.\n• Very limited availability.","description":null,"summary":"The Maybach S-Class represents the top-tier of automotive luxury for discerning buyers.","engineSummaries":[{"title":"S 580 4MATIC","summary":"4.0L V8 biturbo producing 503 bhp and 700 Nm with 48V mild-hybrid.","transmission":"9-speed automatic 4MATIC","power":"503 bhp","torque":"700 Nm","speed":"9-speed 4MATIC","_id":"693d0824f6e9e61342ee839a"},{"title":"S 680 V12","summary":"6.0L V12 producing 612 bhp and 900 Nm for ultimate refinement.","transmission":"9-speed automatic 4MATIC","power":"612 bhp","torque":"900 Nm","speed":"9-speed 4MATIC","_id":"693d0824f6e9e61342ee839b"}],"mileageData":[{"engineName":"S 580","companyClaimed":"8.5 kmpl","cityRealWorld":"5 kmpl","highwayRealWorld":"7 kmpl","_id":"693d0824f6e9e61342ee839c"}],"faqs":[{"question":"What makes Maybach special?","answer":"Maybach adds extended wheelbase, exclusive materials, rear executive seats, and bespoke options unavailable on standard S-Class.","_id":"693d0824f6e9e61342ee839d"}],"brandName":"Mercedes-Benz","searchScore":0.4865211399784437,"matchType":"semantic","isEV":false}],"sessionId":"web-1770844552513","conversationState":{"stage":"greeting","collectedInfo":{},"confidence":0}}
