While the Hyundai Venue also offers Level 2 ADAS and 6 airbags, the Creta's overall safety package is more comprehensive. The Creta's price is also higher, but if safety is a top priority, the Creta is the better choice.\n\nHowever, the Hyundai Venue is still a great option, with its own set of impressive features and a lower price point.\n\n**Hyundai Creta** vs **Tata Sierra** - Quick Verdict\n\n| Factor | Hyundai Creta | Tata Sierra | Winner |\n|--------|----------------|---------------|--------|\n| Price | ₹10.73 L - ₹20.20 L | ₹N/A L - ₹N/A L | Creta |\n| Safety | 6 airbags, electronic stability control, vehicle stability management, Level 2 ADAS | NA | Creta |\n| Mileage | NA | NA | - |\n\n**Key Differences:**\n1.

That boxy shape with the wraparound rear glass is something you don't see every day on the road. It's definitely eye-catching.\n\nOne thing that sets the Sierra apart from other cars is its triple-screen dashboard. You get a big 12.3-inch display for passengers, which is basically a mini entertainment system with streaming and gaming capabilities.\n\nSpace-wise, the Sierra has got a lot to offer. The boot is a roomy 622 liters, but fold down those seats and you can get up to 1257 liters of cargo space. That's seriously impressive.\n\nThe audio system in the Sierra is also worth mentioning. It's a 12-speaker setup from JBL, complete with Dolby Atmos and 18 different audio modes. I've gotta say, it sounds pretty sweet.\n\nIf you're looking for natural light, the Sierra's got you covered. It's got the largest panoramic sunroof in its class, measuring 1525 by 925 millimeters. That's not just a nice feature - it's a game-changer for rear passengers.","cons":"NA Petrol Power: 106 PS base engine may feel underpowered for highway overtakes.\nNo AWD Option: FWD-only configuration, unlike some rivals offering 4x4.\nNew Product: Long-term reliability and service experience yet to be established.\nFuel Efficiency: Turbo petrol delivers 8-10 kmpl city, which may concern economy-focused buyers.","summary":"The Tata Sierra makes a comeback after 3 decades with a completely reimagined design. The \"TheatrePro\" cabin features a triple-screen dashboard layout—a segment first—with a dedicated 12.3-inch passenger entertainment display for streaming and gaming. The iconic wraparound rear glass and boxy silhouette pay tribute to the original 1991 Sierra while offering modern conveniences like \"Boss Mode\" rear seats that can slide the front passenger seat for maximum legroom.","brandName":"Tata","matchType":"keyword","searchScore":0.5,"isEV":false},{"_id":"690d787419f32a352512182b","id":"model-brand-hyundai-creta","name":"Creta","brandId":"brand-hyundai","bodyType":"SUV","fuelTypes":["petrol","diesel"],"pros":"The safety features on the Creta are pretty impressive. It comes standard with six airbags, electronic stability control, vehicle stability management, and a Level 2 advanced driver assistance system that covers 19 different safety features. \n\nIn terms of comfort, I've got to say the Creta's got some nice touches. You'll find a panoramic sunroof that you can control with your voice, ventilated front seats to keep you cool on hot days, and an 8-way power driver seat for adjusting to your liking.\n\nNow, let's talk about the tech. The Creta's got a pair of 10.25-inch screens - one for the infotainment system and another for the cluster display. And if you're an audiophile, you'll appreciate the Bose sound system with eight speakers. It's also got Bluelink connectivity, which allows you to connect your phone and access all sorts of features.\n\nWhen it comes to the engine, you've got three options: petrol, diesel, and turbo petrol. And to go along with that, there are four transmission choices to suit your driving style.","cons":"Price Premium: The Creta's higher variants, which come equipped with ADAS and Turbo Multi-Clutch, do command a premium price compared to the base models. You'll need to budget a bit more if you're looking for these advanced features.\n\nRear Seat Width: The Creta's rear seat is spacious enough for two, but it can be a squeeze to fit three adults comfortably, especially when compared to some of its wider competitors. If you often find yourself carrying a full load of passengers, you might want to consider other options.\n\nNo Safety Rating (Facelift): As the latest facelift of the Creta has not yet undergone Global NCAP crash testing, we don't have an official safety rating for this new iteration. It's worth mentioning that the pre-facelift model did manage to secure a 3-star rating.","summary":"So you're looking at the Hyundai Creta, right? It's a solid mid-size SUV with a pretty impressive feature list. I mean, the interior space is generous, and you'll find a ton of amenities, like blind-spot monitoring, 360-degree camera, and even a panoramic sunroof.\n\nThe driving experience is pretty good, to be honest. The 1.5-litre petrol and diesel engines are both respectable options, and the automatic and manual gearboxes are smooth. What's more, it's not like one engine is a clear winner over the other - both handle pretty well. It's a decent choice, and the quality feels consistent throughout.","maxPrice":2019855,"minPrice":1072589,"brandName":"Hyundai","matchType":"keyword","searchScore":0.5,"isEV":false},{"_id":"691c57d8bbcdfbc213a9c379","id":"model-brand-hyundai-venue-1","name":"Venue","brandId":"brand-hyundai","bodyType":"SUV","fuelTypes":["petrol","diesel"],"pros":"Tech-Loaded: Features a dashcam, power driver seat, and 60+ Bluelink connected comes with.\nAdvanced Safety: Level 2 ADAS with 16 safety has and standard 6 airbags.\nEngine Variety: Offers petrol, turbo-petrol, and diesel engines with manual and automatic options.\nCompact & Agile: Easy to drive in the city with great visibility and handling.","cons":"Rear Space: The rear seat space is good for two but can be tight for three adults.\nRide Quality: The suspension can feel a bit stiff on bad roads compared to some rivals.\nPrice: Top variants can get expensive for the compact SUV segment.","summary":"The Hyundai Venue is a stylish compact SUV known for its bold looks and tech-loaded cabin.
